# Atom plugins

[**Atom**][2] is an open source, cross platform, hackable text editor created at Github. It is easily customisable and the community have developed a wealth of amazing plugins. Atom works great straight out of the box but I would advise diving down the rabbit hole into the realm of [Atom plugins][3].

I imagine most developers have had a moment where they thought "Dam, it would be so useful if I could do this in the editor!" well there's a good chance someone has built it for Atom and if not then have a go!
I can't wait to build my first plugin.

Plugins can be found through the editors package manager or the [website][3].

The Atom editor has really great documentation which tells you all the ins & outs of atom, how to use it and how to extend it.

Atom brings you [The Flight Manual][7], thanks guys :)

Always looking for more great Atom plugins/tips/tricks so spread the love and send us your pull requests.

## Tips

**Packages** can be installed from the command line as well as from inside the editor
```
apm install <package_name>
```

#### Linux
If you cd into your project directory you can open atom already showing the relevant project

```
cd <Path>
```
```
atom

```

## Plugins

A list of really useful Atom plugins

[File Icons][1] - Improves file tree readibility.Choose from colour or grey icons.

[Git Plus][4] - Allows you to do most git commands (add, commit, branch commands, push...) from within the editor. This speeds up git use and makes the interaction between coding and using git an even smoother experience. Another great feature is that once you edit a file it will be orange in the file tree until it has been commited. This makes keeping track of changes and finding what you're working on super easy. Last but not least it shows which branch you are currently on in the bottom right corner of the editor, a small feature but really useful.

[Git Blame][5] - This puts the creation date and the username of the creator in the editors gutter.

[Color Highlight][6] - Highlights any colour defining code with that colour. Really useful for styling, spot that hex error before you've even reached the browser!

[Language Gherkin][8] - Highlighting for gherkin. Seriously useful for testing with Cucumber

[motepair][9] - Remote pair programming package. Works straight out the box. Just start a session, start typing and your pair partner will see you coding realtime! This is great fun and really useful.
